1 Make sure that the edges re stored in sorted order by nodes like:
0  1   0.5
0  1   0.4
0  2   0.9
1  2   0.8
So that I can easily cumulte the edges without having to read the value
in the matrix when building the linear systems.


2 Change getVoltage to return the voltages for each pair of focals
instead of cumulating them
