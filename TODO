1 Make sure that the edges re stored in sorted order by nodes like:
0  1   0.5
0  1   0.4
0  2   0.9
1  2   0.8
So that I can easily cumulte the edges without having to read the value
in the matrix when building the linear systems.


2 Keep track of the positions of the matrix where each edge had an influence
